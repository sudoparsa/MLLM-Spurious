Prompt: I have an image in which I suspect the object [CLASSNAME] might be present. Before answering, let's carefully analyze the image step by step:
First, observe the main elements of the image and describe what you see. Focus on colors, shapes, and patterns that could be associated with [CLASSNAME].
Next, think about whether these elements are sufficient to confidently identify [CLASSNAME]. Are these features unique to [CLASSNAME], or could they belong to other objects as well?
Finally, based on your analysis, state whether you see [CLASSNAME] in the image. Explicitly state your final answer in the format: 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No.'

The presence of ski poles and the person wearing a helmet and standing on a snow-covered slope are indicative of skiing. However, ski poles can also be used in other winter sports, such as snowshoeing or cross-country skiing. The helmet is also commonly worn in winter sports for safety.\n\nBased on my analysis, I see ski in the image. The presence of ski poles and the person wearing a helmet and standing on a snow-covered slope are indicative of skiing.
