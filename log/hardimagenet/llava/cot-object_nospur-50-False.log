Prompt: I have an image in which I suspect the object [CLASSNAME] might be present. Before answering, let's carefully analyze the image step by step:
First, observe the main elements of the image and describe what you see. Focus on colors, shapes, and patterns that could be associated with [CLASSNAME].
Next, think about whether these elements are sufficient to confidently identify [CLASSNAME]. Are these features unique to [CLASSNAME], or could they belong to other objects as well?
Finally, based on your analysis, state whether you see [CLASSNAME] in the image. Explicitly state your final answer in the format: 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No.'

The floor appears to be made of stone tiles, and there are plants and shrubs around the area.\n\nNext, I think about whether these elements are sufficient to confidently identify [patio]. The presence of the wicker chairs, the table, and the potted plant on the table suggest an outdoor seating area, which is commonly found on patios. However, the presence of these elements alone is not enough to definitively identify the object as a patio. These features could also belong to other outdoor seating areas, such as a balcony or a garden.\n\nFinally, based on my analysis, my final answer is: 'Final Answer: No.' While the image does show an outdoor seating area, it is not possible to confidently identify it as a patio based solely on the elements present in the image.

The presence of the umbrella, table, and chairs suggests a space designed for outdoor dining or relaxation.

Explicitly state your final answer in the format: 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No.'" ::: res='First, I observe the main elements of the image. The image shows a person standing on a boat, wearing a black rain poncho, yellow flippers, and a green and yellow bandana. The person is also making a peace sign with their hands.\n\nNext, I think about whether these elements are sufficient to confidently identify a snorkel. The yellow flippers are a common feature of snorkels, but they are also commonly worn by people for swimming or other water activities. The green and yellow bandana could be associated with a snorkel, as some snorkels have colorful straps, but it is not a unique feature of a snorkel. The black rain poncho is not associated with a snorkel.\n\nBased on my analysis, I do not see a snorkel in the image. The yellow flippers are present, but they are not a unique feature of a snorkel, and there is no other evidence of a snorkel in the image.\n\nFinal Answer: No. ' ::: path=/workspace/MLLM-Spurious/HardImageNet_Images/train/n04251144/n04251144_14099.JPEG
