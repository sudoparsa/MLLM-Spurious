Prompt: I have an image in which I suspect the object [CLASSNAME] might be present. Before answering, let's carefully analyze the image step by step:
First, observe the main elements of the image and describe what you see. Focus on colors, shapes, and patterns that could be associated with [CLASSNAME].
Next, think about whether these elements are sufficient to confidently identify [CLASSNAME]. Are these features unique to [CLASSNAME], or could they belong to other objects as well?
Finally, based on your analysis, state whether you see [CLASSNAME] in the image. Explicitly state your final answer in the format: 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No.'
